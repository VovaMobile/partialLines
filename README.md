# Partial Lines

This addon has several operations dealing with lines:
* NVDA+shift+delete changes the up/down arrows to read from the start of the line to the cursor, from the cursor to the end of the line, or the entire line.
* NVDA+shift+page up reads from the start of the line to the cursor
* NVDA+shift+page down reads from the cursor to the end of the line.
